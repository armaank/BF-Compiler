# BF-Compiler
So, when I first learned about compilers, I was pretty blown away by how they work. I should preface this by saying that I'm actually not too interested in programming, nevertheless, I'm interested enough in compilers to actually try to make one. 
I decided to make a compiler for BrainFuck because it has a very limited instruction set, so I figure it might be a simple starting point, with the eventual goal for making a compiler for a subset of C, or C++.
